* Produced code with an R script file, then, inserted it in a R markdown document to display the findings and analysis.
* The following R packages are used: shiny, dplyr, ggplot2 and ggmap.
* Data wrangling functions via dplyr package:
  <ul> 1. Grouped by incident no. </ul>
  <ul> 2. Filtered the data frame to only include offense type "ARSON" </ul>
  <ul> 3. Selected six columns for display. </ul>
