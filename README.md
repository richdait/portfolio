## Project 1: **[Report on Crime in Boston](https://richdait.github.io/Extra-Credit---Crime-in-Boston/)**
* Created a report via time series data with a minimum of 1000 observations for crime in Boston.
* Inserted R script with code into an R markdown document to display findings and analysis.
* Data wrangling functions via dplyr package:
  <ul> 1. Grouped by incident no. </ul>
  <ul> 2. Filtered the data frame to only include offense type "ARSON" </ul>
  <ul> 3. Selected 6 relevant columns for display. </ul>
* Data visualization via ggplot2:
  <ul> 1. Rendered a vertical bar chart displaying frequency (measured in days of the week), in which arson occurred. </ul>
  <ul> 2. Created a background of map tiles.</ul>
  <ul> 3. Added point data (Long, Lat) of locations where arson happened on the map.</ul>
* The project provided valuable insights into forecasting criminal activities, that may result in improving policies and BPD decision-making.

# GIS Data Analysis

## Project 3: **[Smart Dashboard Illustrating the Spatial Variation of Poverty in Seattle](https://richdait.github.io/Final_Project_Poverty/poverty)**
* Created an interactive digital application, illustrating a real-world problem and critically analyzing its implications on society.
* Users are able to interact with the dashboard by clicking on a census tract polygon, which displays an associated poverty percentage.
* Procured shapefile from Seattle Open Data Portal and converted it to GeoJSON via QGIS.
* Icons from Font Awesome direct users to relevant sites and clickable links provide readers further info regarding poverty.
* The final project not only allowed me to research a topic I am passionate about, but give me the platform to refine my programming and GIS skills.

# Web Development and Design
***
## Project 7: **[Hangry in Seattle](https://richdait.github.io/)**
* Produced a fully-functional, responsive website using Github pages.
* Personalized the grayscale Bootstrap-based template to align with the aesthetic and theme - food photography.
* User interface (UI) design:
<ul> 1. Modified CSS and HTML lines of code to facilitate usability and improve site organization. </ul>
<ul> 2. Tabs allow the user quick and easy access to information and specific areas of the website. </ul>
<ul> 3. Social media icons at the bottom instantly direct users to relevant and helpful third-party sites. </ul>

* The project allowed me to re-familiarze myself with Github, hone my skills in markdown syntax, create a Bootstrap-based responsive website and most importantly, showcase the burgeoning food scene in Seattle.

## Project 8: **[Web Design and Tile Generation](https://richdait.github.io/Socioeconomic_Index_and_Seahawks_Tile_Sets/index.html)**
* Created 4 tile sets using various basemaps illustrating a geographic phenomena and theme of choice.
* Basemap of Seattle was designed via MapBox Studio.
* Generated and read map tiles through QGIS.
* Users are able to interact with the site via 3 radio buttons of basemaps and 4 overlays.
* One thing I learned from this project is that something as simple as implementing UI controls, increases user engagement.

## Project 9: **[Interactive Web Application of the Number of Airports in the U.S.](https://richdait.github.io/lab4_WebMapApp/)**
* Created an interactive web map, depicting the number of airports within each state, according to pre-defined data intervals and whether the airport itself, contains an air traffic control tower.
* OpenStreetMap basemap was used and GeoJSON data loaded via the Leaflet ajax plugin.
* User is able click on airplane icons courtesy of Font Awesome to determine the abbreviated name of an air traffic control tower. 
* Fundamental cartographic elements such as a legend and scale are included.
* The project taught me that choosing the right color scheme is important as it brings to light, the highest and lowest values in the dataset. Additionally, it makes the map more appealing and raises possible questions with the user.
