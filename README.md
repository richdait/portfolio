# Data Science

## Project 1: **[Report on Crime in Boston](https://richdait.github.io/Extra-Credit---Crime-in-Boston/)**
* Created a report using time series data with a minimum of 1000 observations for crime in Boston.
* Produced code with an R script file, then, inserted it into an R markdown document to display the findings and analysis.
* Data wrangling functions via dplyr package:
  <ul> 1. Grouped by incident no. </ul>
  <ul> 2. Filtered the data frame to only include offense type "ARSON" </ul>
  <ul> 3. Selected 6 relevant columns for display. </ul>
* Data visualization via ggplot2:
  <ul> 1. Rendered a vertical bar chart displaying frequency (measured in days of the week) in which arson occurred. </ul>
  <ul> 2. Created a background of map tiles.</ul>
  <ul> 3. Added point data (Long, Lat) of where arson occurred on the map.</ul>
* The project provided valuable insights into forecasting criminal activities, that may result in improving policies and BPD decision-making.

## Project 3: **[Smart Dashboard Illustrating the Spatial Variation of Poverty in Seattle](https://richdait.github.io/Final_Project_Poverty/poverty)**
* Created an interactive digital application (i.e., smart dashboard), illustrating a real-world problem and critically analyzing its implications on society.
* Users are able to interact with the dashboard by clicking on a census tract polygon, which displays an associated poverty percentage.
* Procured shapefile from Seattle Open Data Portal and converted it to GeoJSON via QGIS.
* Icons from Font Awesome direct user to relevant sites and clickable links provide readers further info regarding poverty.
* The final project not only allowed me to research a topic I am passionate about, but give me the platform to refine my programming and GIS skills.

# Web Development

## Project 7: **[Hangry in Seattle](https://richdait.github.io/)**
* Produced a fully-functional, responsive website using Github pages.
* Personalized the grayscale Bootstrap-based template to align with the aesthetic and theme - food photography.
* User interface (UI) design:
<ul> 1. CSS and HTML codes were modified to facilitate usability and improve site content organization. </ul>
<ul> 2. Tabs allow the user quick and easy access to information and specific areas of the website. </ul>
<ul> 3. Social media icons at the bottom instantly direct users to relevant and helpful third-party sites. </ul>
* The project allowed me to re-familiarze myself with Github, hone my skills in markdown syntax, create a Bootstrap-based responsive website and most importantly, showcase the burgeoning food scene in Seattle.
