## Project 1: **[Report on Crime in Boston](https://richdait.github.io/Extra-Credit---Crime-in-Boston/)**
* Created a report via time series data with a minimum of 1000 observations for crime in Boston.
* Inserted R script with code into an R markdown document to display findings and analysis.
* Data wrangling functions via dplyr package:
  <ul> 1. Grouped by incident no. </ul>
  <ul> 2. Filtered the data frame to only include offense type "ARSON" </ul>
  <ul> 3. Selected 6 relevant columns for display. </ul>
* Data visualization via ggplot2:
  <ul> 1. Rendered a vertical bar chart displaying frequency (measured in days of the week), in which arson occurred. </ul>
  <ul> 2. Created a background of map tiles.</ul>
  <ul> 3. Added point data (Long, Lat) of locations where arson happened on the map.</ul>
* The project provided valuable insights into forecasting criminal activities, that may result in improving policies and BPD decision-making.

# GIS Data Analysis

## Project 3: **[Smart Dashboard Illustrating the Spatial Variation of Poverty in Seattle](https://richdait.github.io/Final_Project_Poverty/poverty)**
* Created an interactive digital application, illustrating a real-world problem and critically analyzing its implications on society.
* Users are able to interact with the dashboard by clicking on a census tract polygon, which displays an associated poverty percentage.
* Procured shapefile from Seattle Open Data Portal and converted it to GeoJSON via QGIS.
* Icons from Font Awesome direct users to relevant sites and clickable links provide readers further info regarding poverty.
* The final project not only allowed me to research a topic I am passionate about, but give me the platform to refine my programming and GIS skills.

# Web Development and Design
***
## Project 7: **[Hangry in Seattle](https://richdait.github.io/)**
* Produced a fully-functional, responsive website using Github pages.
* Personalized the grayscale Bootstrap-based template to align with the aesthetic and theme - food photography.
* User interface (UI) design:
<ul> 1. Modified CSS and HTML lines of code to facilitate usability and improve site organization. </ul>
<ul> 2. Tabs allow the user quick and easy access to information and specific areas of the website. </ul>
<ul> 3. Social media icons at the bottom instantly direct users to relevant and helpful third-party sites. </ul>

* The project allowed me to re-familiarze myself with Github, hone my skills in markdown syntax, create a Bootstrap-based responsive website and most importantly, showcase the burgeoning food scene in Seattle.

## Project 8: **[Web Design and Tile Generation](https://richdait.github.io/Socioeconomic_Index_and_Seahawks_Tile_Sets/index.html)**
* Created 4 tile sets using various basemaps illustrating a geographic phenomena and theme of choice.
* Basemap of Seattle was designed via MapBox Studio.
* Generated and read map tiles through QGIS.
* Users are able to interact with the site via 3 radio buttons of basemaps and 4 grouped overlays.
* One thing I learned from this project is that something as simple as implementing UI controls, increases user engagement.
