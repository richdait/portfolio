## Project 1: **[Report on Crime in Boston](https://richdait.github.io/Extra-Credit---Crime-in-Boston/)**
* Created a report using time series data with a minimum of 1000 observations for crime in Boston.
* Produced code with an R script file, then, inserted it into an R markdown document to display the findings and analysis.
* Data wrangling functions via dplyr package:
  <ul> 1. Grouped by incident no. </ul>
  <ul> 2. Filtered the data frame to only include offense type "ARSON" </ul>
  <ul> 3. Selected 6 relevant columns for display. </ul>
* Data visualization via ggplot2:
  <ul> 1. Rendered a vertical bar chart displaying frequency (measured in days of the week) in which arson occurred. </ul>
  <ul> 2. Created a background of map tiles.</ul>
  <ul> 3. Added point data (Long, Lat) of where arson occurred on the map.</ul>
* The project provided valuable insights into forecasting criminal activities, that may result in improving policies and BPD decision-making.
