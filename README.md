## Project 1: **[Report on Crime in Boston](https://richdait.github.io/Extra-Credit---Crime-in-Boston/)** (Link to [repository](https://github.com/richdait/Extra-Credit---Crime-in-Boston))
* Created a report using time series data with a minimum of 1000 observations for crime in Boston.
* Produced code with an R script file, then, inserted it into an R markdown document to display the findings and analysis.
* Data wrangling functions via dplyr package:
  <ul> 1. Grouped by incident no. </ul>
  <ul> 2. Filtered the data frame to only include offense type "ARSON" </ul>
  <ul> 3. Selected 6 relevant columns for display. </ul>
* Data visualization via ggplot2:
  <ul> 1. Rendered a vertical bar chart displaying frequency (measured in days of the week) in which arson occurred. </ul>
  <ul> 2. Created a background of map tiles.</ul>
  <ul> 3. Added point data (Long, Lat) of where arson occurred on the map.</ul>
* The project provided valuable insights into forecasting criminal activities, that may result in improving policies and BPD decision-making.

## Project 7: **[Hangry in Seattle](https://richdait.github.io/)**(Link to [repository](https://github.com/richdait/richdait.github.io))
* Produced a fully-functional, responsive website using Github pages.
* Designed and personalized the grayscale Bootstrap-based template to align with the aesthetic and theme - food photography.
* User interface (UI) design:
<ul> 1. CSS and HTML codes were modified to facilitate usability and improve site content organization. </ul>
<ul> 2. Tabs allow the user quick and easy access to information and specific areas of the website. </ul>
<ul> 3. Social media icons at the bottom instantly direct users to relevant and helpful third-party sites. </ul>
* The project allowed me to re-familiarze myself with Github, hone my skills in markdown syntax, create a Bootstrap-based responsive website and most importantly, showcase the burgeoning food scene in Seattle.
